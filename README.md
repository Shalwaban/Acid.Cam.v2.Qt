To develop C++ filters that the program will load dynamically see the example
filter in the plugins directory. The program will look for two functions:

void pixel(int x, int y, unsigned char *buffer);

void complete();

pixel is called once for every pixel in the frame and complete is called
when every pixel has been drawn.
